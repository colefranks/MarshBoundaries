I managed to color 4 landscapes separately and show them individually as well as all together.
Please note that the 4 landscapes doesn't completely cover the entire area so there are some pixels left white between the boundary of them. Hope this doesn't creat too much problem.
I was coloring them using a graphical function in GIS so maybe the color is slightly different when they all show up in the same image.
I checked the alighment in GIS but you could check again as the 5 images should have the same frame.
